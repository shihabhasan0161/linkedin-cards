   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add feature: description of your changes"
   ```

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. **Create a Pull Request** on GitHub:

## Adding New Languages

We encourage adding support for new languages! Here's how:

1. Create a new JSON file in the `lang/` directory (e.g., `pt.json` for Portuguese)

2. Add the following translations:
   ```json
   {
     "second": "segundo",
     "seconds": "segundos",
     "minute": "minuto",
     "minutes": "minutos",
     "hour": "hora",
     "hours": "horas",
     "day": "dia",
     "days": "dias",
     "week": "semana",
     "weeks": "semanas",
     "month": "mês",
     "months": "meses",
     "year": "ano",
     "years": "anos",
     "ago": "Há",
     "comments": "comentários",
     "invertOrder": true
   }
   ```

3. Set `invertOrder: true` if your language places "ago" at the beginning (like Spanish: "Hace 3 semanas")

4. Test the new language:
   ```bash
   LANGUAGE=pt node scripts/auto-generate.js
   ```

5. Update the README.md to list the new language in the "Supported Languages" section

6. Submit a pull request with your changes

## Coding Guidelines

### JavaScript Style

- Use **ES6+ features** (const/let, arrow functions, async/await)
- Use **meaningful variable names** that describe their purpose
- Follow the existing code style in the project
- Add **comments** for complex logic
- Keep functions **small and focused** on a single task

### File Organization

- Place reusable logic in the `lib/` directory
- Keep executable scripts in the `scripts/` directory
- Store SVG templates in the `templates/` directory
- Add language files to the `lang/` directory

### Commits

- Write clear, concise commit messages
- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Reference issues and PRs when relevant
- Keep commits focused on a single change

### SVG Templates

- Maintain both light and dark theme versions
- Ensure responsive design (width and viewBox)
- Test with different content lengths
- Keep file sizes optimized

## Testing

Before submitting a pull request:

1. **Test the generator** with your changes:
   ```bash
   node scripts/auto-generate.js
   ```

2. **Verify the generated cards** look correct:
   - Check both light and dark themes
   - Test with different content types (text-only, with images)
   - Verify different languages if applicable

3. **Test the GitHub Action** locally if possible or in your fork

4. **Check for errors** in the console output

## Questions?

If you have questions or need help:

- Open an issue with the "question" label
- Check existing issues to see if your question has been answered
- Review the README.md for usage instructions
